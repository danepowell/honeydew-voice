# Honeydew Grocery List

Honeydew is a simple grocery list designed for families and available for Android, Alex, and Google Assistant.

## Honeydew Voice

This is the common voice library for the Alexa and Google Assistant apps.

## Other Honeydew components

You can build the library, but it won't be super interesting on its own. The real magic is in the syncing with other devices and services, which require other components:
